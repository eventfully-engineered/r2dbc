# Rust Relational Database Connectivity (RSDBC)

R<sup>2</sup>DBC (R-squared DBC) aka Rust Relation Database Connectivity or just Rust Database Connectivity is a common API around accessing relational databases. This was initially inspired by [RDBC](https://github.com/tokio-rs/rdbc) and similar to that project RSDBC is not attempting to build new drivers but instead wrap existing drivers around a common API.

NOTE: WIP. Placeholder. Nothing to see here at the moment.
